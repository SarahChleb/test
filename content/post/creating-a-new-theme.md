## Static Sites:
* collection of static web pages
* hard coded: the pages do not change, everybody gets the same page
* Cheap
* Fast
* Easy development
* Scalable
* Secure
* Version control of content: You can follow the changes of the content and the editor who changed and when it was done!

## Dynamic sites:
* dynamically generated
* More functions
* Easy management (CMS)
* Customized content
* Database storage (MySQL, Oracleâ€¦ are not ideal for storing content)
* Only single upload
* Realtime updates (very important for E-commerce)
* slower - every webpage is built up on demand
* expensive
