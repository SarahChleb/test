## Static Website Generator (SWG)

A Static Website Generator (SWG) is an item that helps building websites with little or no changes over time - so static websites.
Before the SWGs came up static websites were generated by backend HTML programming. A dynamic website needs a CMS to be operated.
SWGs try to combine the advantages of backend programming and CMS:
Content creation via simple markup (often Markdown), no need to dig into HTML
Separation of content and style(s)
Support for well structured (textual) content

Dynamic websites are usually build with and stored in a CMS. A SWG is the tool to build a static website. But the content is not stored there.The storage is more flexible. It could be for example on the hard drive of a personal computer, on a server or for huge amounts of content in a database on server.
