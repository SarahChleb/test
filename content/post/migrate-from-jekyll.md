## Benefits
* Building websites for static content (that doesnâ€™t change regularly)
* Website Producer can focus on content instead of plain HTML because of a simple editing syntax
* Design can be done separately

## Drawbacks:
* Website Producer has to be at least a bit tech-savvy
* Maintenance is difficult
* No search capability - to find something you have to read through the page
* No user interaction
